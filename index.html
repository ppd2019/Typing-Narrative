      Typing has become one of the most used methods of depicting idea communication in the form of text, data or code. We might not use our computer keyboards everyday, but we all use our smartphone keyboards to input text in our applications. Typing is everywhere.
      For an activity as widespread as typing, awareness about it is quite limited. We spend several minutes, if not hours, of our day typing information into our devices. Can you imagine how much time we will save if we were able to do the task faster!
      Let’s learn some trivia about typing before we delve deeper into its hows and whys.</p>
      <h2>Typing terminologies</h2>
      <p>Basically, typing is the act of writing or inputting text by pressing the designated keys on a typewriter, computer keyboard, cell phone, calculator, or any other device which lets you input data through letters, numbers or symbols. <br> There are three methods of measuring one’s typing speed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Characters per Minute (CPM)</h3> 
          <P>Any key which prints on your screen is counted as a character. Number of characters typed in a minute would be considered your CPM speed.</P>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Words per Minute (WPM)</h3> 
          <P>Number of correct words typed in a minute is the data used to measure your WPM speed.</P>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Key Strokes per Hour/ Key Depressions per Hour (DPH)</h3> 
          <P>
            Key strokes/ key depressions have the same definition as characters specified above. However, this method measures the numbers of key depressions you are able to make in an hour instead of a minute.
          </P>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>History of Typing</h2>
      <p>
        Typing is omnipresent, but it has developed exponentially to reach its current popularity as a method of data input. The first typing devices were designed and patented in the 1700s while the first manufactured typing devices came about in the 1870s. Since then, technology and design has come a long way to improve the efficiency of the activity. The QWERTY layout of keys, however, has remained the same. Established with the advent of typewriters, computers, and smartphones have made typing an everyday activity now.
      <br>From its humble beginnings in the form of a typewriter to the technological advances which led to touch screen typing in the 21st century, typing has advanced significantly.
    </p>
      <h2>Statistics about Typing</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we have seen how typing has evolved over the years, let's go back to the basics.<br>
        Writing by hand, where it all began.<br>
        Handwriting has several benefits when it comes to memory retention, reducing distractions and enhancing creativity as compared to typing. However, it can be tedious and tiring, and might not be the best medium to share your thoughts with other people. When it comes to speed, typing triumphs.

    <p>
      As we can see in the above graph, typing is a much faster way of putting down information in comparison to writing by hand. It certainly is easier to access a computer nowadays than a piece of paper!
      <br>Talking about the ease of access to computers brings us to the variety of devices surrounding us on a daily basis. The variety of devices bring with them a wide range of choices for keyboards, ranging from mechanical to touch screen keypads. Consequently, people’s efficiency in using them changes with the product. The graph below depicts how the average WPM speed changes with change in medium of the keyboard.

    <p>
      Analysis of the preceding graph demonstrates that the mechanical keyboard is the go-to medium for fast typing for an average person. All the chatting on the internet has certainly helped!
      <br>The familiar clicking and rattling sounds of a mechanical keyboard transport one directly into an office environment. In fact, there are many office-going professionals who need exceptional typing skills in order to stand out at their jobs. Let’s compare what the WPM speed looks like for different professions.
      <br>Everyone types, but some type more than others. Let's compare the WPM speed for a few regular typers and find out where they stand next to each other!
      <br>With all this typing analysis of others, you must be wondering where do you stand on the podium.

      </li>
      <li> 
        Faster typing speed will mean that you will be able to reduce the time spent at your desk, and that will lead to more time spent standing up and stretching so as not to hurt your back, neck, and shoulders.
      </li>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      All of this sounds valid. But how will we be able to achieve this?
      <Br>Here are some useful tips to help you type faster.
      </Br>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>Improve Your Workspace : </i> Your workspace should be clean, properly ventilated, and comfortable. Also, for optimal typing, you will need to get a table and not work with your laptop or computer on your lap.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Fix Your Posture : </i> If you want to type well, the correct posture will be seated, straight backed, and with your feet planted a little apart, flat on the ground. You wrists should also be positioned in such a way that your fingers can cover the keyboard. Tilt your head a bit as you can look at the screen properly as well. It is also very important that you keep this position as you type.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Familiarize Yourself with the Keyboard : </i> Work on memorizing the positions of the letter keys, as well as some of the most used punctuation marks. You will need to understand where they are without looking at the keyboard. One way to remember the keys is to close your eyes and say the keys out loud as you press them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Slowly With Touch-Typing : </i> The quickest way to master typing will be learning touch typing. Once you can type key combinations without looking at the keyboard layout, your speed will increase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Don’t Look at Your Hands : </i> Keep yourself from looking at your keyboard as you type so that your fingers are made to learn how the keys work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Practice, Practice, Practice : </i> Mastering the touch typing technique will prove to be a bit finicky, but once your posture is up and you get your fingers where they should be, you can only improve by practicing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Typing fast can come in handy even when you are applying for jobs. Even as more and more of us are talking into our phones and computers these days, typing is still certain to play an important role in our lives for many years to come.
        <br>Learning how to type well will never be a waste of time.
